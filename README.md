## Plagiarism
There was an instance where another user submitted my assignment AS HIS (shamelessly linked my GitHub page for that assignment). I flagged it right after noticing but unfortunately, I won't be able to know when it happens again later on (now that I'm done with this course). These solution links are easily accessible via Google but if you really want to learn and you happened to stumble upon my repo by looking for someone to copy from, please refrain from using my EXACT work to pass the course. You'll reap what you sow in the end, after all. You can't learn by doing nothing. You can use these for reference, but please observe decency and work for it.
