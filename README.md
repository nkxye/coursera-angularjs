## Plagiarism
There was an instance where another user submitted my assignment AS HIS (shamelessly linked my GitHub page for that assignment). I flagged it right away when I saw it but I won't be able to know when it happens again later on (now that I'm almost done with this course). Therefore, if you really want to grow and learn--and you're reading this right now, please refrain from using my exact work to pass the course. You'll reap what you sow in the end, after all. You can use these as references, but please don't be rude like that and work for it.
